          <p class="about__text">
            I am an aspiring Front-End Developer with a strong focus on creating
            modern, responsive web applications. My journey into technology
            began early, fueled by a fascination with how things work. From
            building my first PC to experimenting with tools like Adobe
            Photoshop, I discovered a passion for blending creativity with
            technical skills.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            Currently, I am focused on web development. This website is my first
            Front-End creation, designed and built from the ground up using
            HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. Aside from this website I have
            developed two React-based applications using TypeScript: a To-Do App
            and a Weather App that utilizes APIs for real-time data fetching.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            Outside of coding, I freelance as a graphic designer, which has
            sharpened my eye for design and user experience. I also hold a
            Python certification from Cisco. Python was the first programming
            language I learned.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            You can explore my projects and other work in the Projects section
            of this site. I am excited to take the next step as a Front-End
            Developer, combining my skills and creativity to craft engaging user
            experiences.

                When I'm not working or coding, I like to focus on activities
                that keep me engaged and bring me joy. Here’s how I make the
                most of my free time.

              <p class="card__text">
                I'm all about outdoors and adventures. Nature has always had a
                special place in my heart. Whether it is an easy and relaxing
                trail or a challenging climb, hiking always clears my mind and
                gives me joy.

                Riding a motorcycle is all about freedom. Discovering new routes
                or revisiting known ones never gets old for me. Sometimes all I
                need is the open road and some gas. It's also great for
                commuting.

                Ever since I was young basketball was the sport that felt
                special to me. I like to play it and I like to watch it. 1 vs 1,
                3 vs 3 or full court 5 vs 5, it doesn't matter, what matters is
                the game.

                I just love music and I don't think I could live without it. For
                me, sometimes, it can express feelings way better than words.
